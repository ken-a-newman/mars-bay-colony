                        <p>Welcome to the New MarsBayColony Website. Dedicated to proposals and possible execution of commercial services to be delivered from Mars. Of course there wont be Humans on Mars providing the services, but Human engineered devices delivered to Mars that will serve as Avatars for Earthbound Operators to provide the services.</p>

                        <p>This service would be epxected to be ready in five years from contract.</p>

                            <h2>Whats the future for Mars?</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>The current plans for Mars are for Scientific exploration via NASA primarily and Human exploration via Private companies and NASA to a lesser extent.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Scientific Exploration makes perfect sense and is valuable to Humankind. The pace seems incredibly slow. This is understandable given the need for Taxpayers money.</p>
                        
                        <p>Meanwhile the pursuit of Human exploration of Mars is pretty far off. Its not imaginable that Human missions to Mars and back with all hands intact and alive will happen in the next 100 years without billions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money. An Honest cost to benefit analysis would rate this pretty close to 0.</p>
                        
                        <p>So heres an alternative to Scientific and Human exploration: Offer Services performed by Robotic Avatars on Mars.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are over 600 Billionaires in the world.<br>
                        There are literally Millions of Millionaires in the world.</p>
                        
                        <p>We stand in a very unique point in Human History where fantastic, mind blowing technological services can be offered for equally mind blowing prices and yet find a very large pool of potential customers who have the means to pay for these services.</p>
                        
                        <p>These services would generate Tax Revenue rather than drain   Taxpayers and will push the boundaries of Rocket and Robotic technology.</p>
                        
                        <p>Also there is a potential of offering some of the services to schools altruistically to some degree to help ignite the imagination of young people.
