                        <p>Like the Pharaohs  of Egypt: This person(s) will be remembered for a very long time</p>

                        <p>To drop the Grim references, the Deceased will be referred to as "The Explorer"</p>
                        <p>The Explorer would be sealed and preserved in a cigar shaped Sarcophagus referred here as the "Pod" with a small window if requested.</p>
                        <p>A Rocket Vehicle would be launched from Earth with the Explorer, Pod, several Robots, and a light time capsule.</p>
                        <p>Upon Landing in a chosen location on Mars, an Earthbound Funeral director would begin working with Avatar Drivers and the Robots to prepare the Ceremony.</p>
                        <p>The Pod would be arranged to take advantage of a visually spectacular backdrop</p>
                        <p>A large Monitor and Speakers would be arranged in front of the Pod to provide a Visual and Audible Broadcast of the service from Earth.</p>
                        <p>Cameras would be arranged to capture live the service  including the Pod, Monitor, and Backdrop and Broadcast from Mars to Earth</p>
                        <p>The ceremony would take place simutaneously on Earth and Mars with the signals flowing in both directions - with some measure to prevent a feedback loop.</p>
                        <p>The Explorer may elect to make the Signal from Mars available to all - or just to Family</p>
