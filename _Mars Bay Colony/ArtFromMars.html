                        <p>Human Artists can produce Artworks on Mars using Robot Avatars. Quality is going to be very important.</p>
                        <p>The artworks can't just be a pile of stones making a happy face</p>

                        <p>The Wildly speculative cost for a Signed 3 panel Lithograph limited to 100 copies would be about 500 K. There are lots of ways the math could be worked out for this: 1 copy at 100 Million dollars, 5 copies at 20 million etc.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>A Rocket would be launched from Earth to Mars delivering a pair of very special Robots to be used as Avatars.</p>
                        <p>One Robot would be named Michelangelo, the other we'll leave open for now.</p>
                        <p>The landing site will be chosen for offering a collection of stones of varying height and girth. Perfect for sculpting. We will also be looking for a good natural backdrop for the sculptures.</p>
                        <p>An Earthbound sculptor of considerable reputation will be selected and trained to operate The Michelangelo Avatar. A suitable stone will be slected and the Sculptor via Avatar will begin the work.</p>
                        <p>Once the Sculpture is completed, a dramatic and high quality Signed multi panel Lithograph will be produced.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>The second Robot will be skilled in the Art of "Sand Drawing". The same as the Sculptor, an Earthbound Avatar Artist will create magnificent Sand Sculptures which will be captured in Signed Lithograph form. If the wind don't blow.</p>
